Danger Log

1. A user should login before doing any operation, e.g., if someone tries to make a new ride without login, a "Anonymous user" error will occur.

2. A driver can select her vehicle type. Each vehicle type should correspond to a unique capacity, while the driver can still enter a random number. This
  problem is fixed by calling single functions to automatically fill the field.

3. Once a user shares a ride, she can update the number of passenger later. However, the total number of passenger of the ride will keep increasing if she
  keeps updating the ride. Thus, we made a restriction that each sharer can ONLY update a ride ONCE.

4. A driver cannot pick up her OWN rides. We filter out each driver's own rides so they cannot see them.

5. It is difficult to check the vadility of users' email information. In addition, the email sent by the Web App might be treated as spam.

6. The user cannot choose a past time as the arrivial time of a ride. While this is functionally correct, it is unrealistic. We have not yet fixed this bug.

7. When a user searches an open ride by arrivial date, she might choose an invalid time slot, e.g., a latest time that is earlier than the earliest time, or a date in the past.
  these can result in no rides being displayed.
